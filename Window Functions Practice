# a list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed".

Bike lanes with an average safety rating of 4 or more should be labeled "Leave As-Is".
Bike lanes with an average safety rating of less than 2.5 should be labeled as "Remove".
All other bike lanes should be labeled as "Improvements Needed".
To do this, you will need to:

Use AVG(safetyrating) with a window function.
Use OVER to designate the window function.
Use PARTITION BY in the window function to partition the results by street.
Use a CASE statement to create labels for the recommendations for each bike lane.


SELECT street, safetyrating, 
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN "Leave As-Is"
WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN "Remove"
ELSE "Improvements Needed"
END AS "Recommendation"
